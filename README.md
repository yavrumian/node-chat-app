# Node chat app

Simple messaging application written with **Node.js** and used **mongoDB** as a database, also I used **Socket.io** for socket  

This application is already deployed to **Heroku** and you can use with [this link](http://boiling-forest-58781.herokuapp.com/)

If you want to **download** and use it for personal purposes you must follow this steps

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/yavrumian/node-chat-app.git` (For downloading files on your device)
2. Run `npm i` or `npm install` (For installing all modules)
3. Modify `./server/config/config.json` file (For setting enviroment variables)
4. Run `npm test` (For testing all modules and routes)
5. Run `npm start` (For starting the application)
6. And finally visit `localhost:<PORT>` (For enjoying :d)
